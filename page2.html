                        In the first part of the course we were taught skills in C#, Xamarin and ASP.NET.

                    <li>
                        In the second part of the program we had to identify a problem in our communities and develop an app to try to address the 
                        problem. We used agile methedology during development process. My team focused on Early Childhood Development, we developed an
                        app that has content for teachers or caregivers that allows them to engage in activities with kids. The content we were offering
                        was in line with the South African curriculum. I was task to create a web API for authentication purposes for the app.
