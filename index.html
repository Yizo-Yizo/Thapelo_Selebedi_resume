                I am third year Bachelor of science student majoring in Mathematics and Statistics. During my degree I was looking at what 
            careers options do I have. Software development caught my attention, as it requires someone who has aptitude for solving problems
            and that is one of my strongest quality. Hence I embarked on a journey to teach myself skills required for me to be a software engineer.
            I did a course in Mobile development that uses .Net and C# (Xamarin). We worked in teams to identify societal problem and try to bring about
            a digital solution, we were using agile methodology during the development process. I am currently doing an software engineering course, with 
            HyperionDev, during the course I have created a project management program in Java that interacts with a database.
